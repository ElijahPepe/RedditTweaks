## Update
This was originally created to try to "stick it", if you will, to the egregious actions on the behalf of the mods and more specifically at slimy Intel for asking for free publicity on a subreddit with 2.5 million subscribers. The giveaway has now ended and the subreddit has been reverted. Development will be slowed down as I doubt any companies want to deal with this shit anymore. This will still handle giveaway posts.
